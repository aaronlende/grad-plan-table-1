        <nav><a href="https://https://github.com/aaronlende">.NET Programming A.A.S.</a></nav>
        <p>I am new to the programming field as a whole. I have always enjoyed gaming and would love to create my own video game. Rather than pay for cheap "learn in your basement" programs, I thought I would learn a more practical side first. This way I would understand the languages and have an idea where to begin.</p>

        <p>I wish to pursue the A.A.S. for this currently but am completely unable to know what classes I am taking next semester as I have my family to think about before anything else. My wife and I are in the process of reworking our schedules and hope to have a plan soon.</p>
